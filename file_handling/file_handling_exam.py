   - Returns empty dict if file doesn't exist

3. add_student(filename, name, grade):
   - Adds a new student to the grades file
   - Appends without losing existing data

4. get_average_grade(filename):
   - Calculates and returns the average grade from the file
   - Returns 0 if file is empty or doesn't exist

# EXAM TIPS
# ============================================================================
"""
Common File Modes:
- 'r'  : Read (default)
- 'w'  : Write (overwrites file)
- 'a'  : Append (adds to end of file)
- 'r+' : Read and Write
- 'w+' : Write and Read (overwrites file)

Always remember to:
1. Close files after opening (or use 'with' statement)
2. Handle exceptions (try-except blocks)
3. Check if files exist before reading
4. Use appropriate file modes

Good luck! üêç
